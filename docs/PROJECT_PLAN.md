# Project Plan: TTS Data Aggregator

## What I Want to Build
I want to build a beautiful and intuitive application to help me create a high-quality dataset for training a custom text-to-speech (TTS) model. It will be a system for generating short text prompts and recording the corresponding audio.

## The Core Problem
Building a good TTS model requires a large, clean dataset of text and matching audio. Collecting this data is tedious and slow. It's hard to ensure the audio clips are the right length and that the recording process is efficient and enjoyable for the person providing the voice.

## How It Will Work
- The app will present me with a short piece of text (designed to be read aloud in 5-10 seconds).
- This text will be generated by an AI (LLM) or another automated source.
- I will record myself reading the text aloud directly in the app.
- Upon saving, the UI will explicitly link the audio recording to the specific text prompt it was based on, storing them together in the database.
- I'll have simple controls to re-record if I make a mistake, listen to my recording, and move to the next text prompt.

## The Experience I Want
The process should feel less like a chore and more like a simple, satisfying task. The interface should be clean, encouraging, and focused. I want to feel a sense of progress as I contribute more recordings. It should be easy to just sit down, open the app, and start recording without any friction. Features like one-click re-recording or quick playback are important to make the workflow smooth.

## Essential Requirements
- The application must have a very polished and user-friendly interface (UI/UX is critical).
- Text prompts should be generated to be between 5-10 seconds long when read aloud.
- Text generation should preferably use an LLM.
- The system must use a robust database solution capable of handling large audio files. Specific technologies to consider are Supabase or a PostgreSQL database.
- For storing the actual audio files, it should integrate with a cloud storage service like Supabase Storage, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage.
- The data schema should be designed from the start to make it easy to export the data for training a TTS model.

## Success Metrics
- I can successfully record and save hundreds of audio clips in a single session without feeling frustrated.
- The collected dataset (text and audio pairs) is well-organized and easy to export.
- The final quality of the audio recordings is high.
- The user interface feels intuitive and motivating to use.

## The Bigger Picture
This project is the foundational first step towards building a unique, custom text-to-speech model from scratch. A high-quality dataset is the most critical asset for this goal, and this tool is what will make creating that asset possible.
